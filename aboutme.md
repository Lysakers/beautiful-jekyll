subtitle: Father, husband, Office365 admin and Powershell "newbie"
---

I am an Office 365 administrator and servicedesk technician for an intermunicipal company in Norway.  
We handle over 4500 employees and apporx. 6500 students, and are in the process of migrating to a new datacenter. With that comes migration from on-premesis Exchange to cloud and the adoption of the full Office 365 suite of products.  
Finding Powershell in the process of moving to Office 365, I am rather new to the use of it all. Despite that I love trying out new things, playing in the console and learning along the way.  

### my history

Originally studying IT, i found myself bored of school and jumped of my education.
For several years i worked in logistics, before returning to IT a few years ago.
Starting as 1. line support i have worked my way up to Office 365 administrator while still doing some support on 2. line and 3. line level.
