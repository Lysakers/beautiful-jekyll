<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-briefcase"></i></span>I am an Office 365 administrator and servicedesk technician for an intermunicipal company in Norway. We handle over 4500 employees and apporx. 6500 students, and are in the process of migrating to a new datacenter. With that comes migration from on-premesis Exchange to cloud and the adoption of the full Office 365 suite of products. Finding Powershell in the process of moving to Office 365, I am rather new to the use of it all. Despite that I love trying out new things, playing in the console and learning along the way.</li>
  <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i></span>Originally studying IT, i found myself bored of school and jumped of my education.
For several years i worked in logistics, before returning to IT a few years ago.
Starting as 1. line support i have worked my way up to Office 365 administrator while still doing some support on 2. line and 3. line level.</li>
  <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i></span>Fairly new to Powershell, I am learning new and interesting ways to solve problems and extract information. I am hoping to share this with others.</li>
